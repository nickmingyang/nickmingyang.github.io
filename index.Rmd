<h3>Introduction:</h3>
- Coming from a technology background, I accomplished excellent academic achievement earning a Bachelor Degree in Electrical Engineering from Illinois Institute of Technology and a Master Degree in Computer Science from University of Chicago. After graduation, knowing my potential did not lie solely in coding and science, I decided to challenge myself in a completely new field - Luxury Sales. During my four years of B2C/B2B selling, I not only elevated my business mindset to a higher level, but also brought myself to a crossroad of my career path. I am currently pursuing Data Science master degree at SMU, and looking forward to combine my coding and analytical skills with my acquired domain knowledge.
